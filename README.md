# VAWT360
 A Fusion360 plugin for generating self contained modular 3d-printable VAWT assemblies.

Dimensions:

    DRAG:

        Hole Diameter - Inner diameter for turbine shaft

        Shaft Diameter - Outer diameter for the shaft of the turbine

        Outer Diameter - Overall diameter of inner drag-based turbine

        Blade Thickness - Thickness of the inner-drag based turbine blades

        Blade Depth - Depth of each drag-based blade, which is the distance from a line drawn from the start and end of the blade arc, to the top-most point on the arc.

        Blade Count - Number of blades on the drag-based inner turbine

        Twist Count - The coil density for the drag-based inner turbine. 

    LIFT:

        NACA Profile - 4-Digit NACA ID for airfoil shape.

        Airfoil Count - Number of airfoils on the outer ring.

        Chord Length - Length of airfoil chord.

        Distance from Center - Radius of outer circle, distance of outer airfoil from center pivot.

        Flange Size - The logorithmic square of the pythagrial volume (in respect to dG/dT) of Defragulator Flange used.
